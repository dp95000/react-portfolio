# Week 20 Homework Project - Updated Responsive Portfolio (REACT JS)

## Description 

This is the updated version of my personal portfolio site, now running on REACT JS.  It has been updated to include my second group project (Philly Auto Imporium), as well as two more of my best homework assingments.  These include the Burger Logger app and the Note Taker app.  Both of which utilize mySQL and are currently deployed to Heroku.

This portfolio site uses the same HTML & CSS portfolio website that was made for week one and makes it responsive compatible.  I did this by adding a link to the Bootstrap css stylsheet, hosted remotely on Bootstrap's servers.  From there, I just needed to add the needed classes to existing block items.  The end result was the old portfolio that didn't change appearance, in response to resizing my browser window, will now adjust its layout to fit different screen and media sizes.
